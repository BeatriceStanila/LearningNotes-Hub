_Architectural characteristics_ (the nonfunctional requirments) and _logical components_ before you can choose an _architectural style_ (the decision we make after doing a trade-off analysis). _Architectural decisions_ represent the problem domain.

## What are architectural characteristics? "ility"

An architect has to structural design software systems, for which there are two parts:

- Logical components - the domain of the application.

- Architectural characteristics - the important parts of the construction process of a software system or application, regardless of the problem domain (non-domain).

The architectural characteristics can be defined in three parts ðŸ”º:

1. **Nondomain design considerations (explicit)**

- the _requirments_ specify what the application should do
- we need to work with the BA and others experts as early on as possible to create the requirments docuemnt in order to find out what architectural characteristics we need to support

2. **Influences some structural aspect of the design (implicit)**

 - you must consider many trade-offs when making architectural decisions, such as whether to use a monolithic versus distributed physical architecture.

3. **Crictical or important to application success**

Try to pick as few architectural characteristics as possible, rather than as many as possible. This is because architectural characteristics are:

- impossible to standardize: different organizations use different terms for the same architectural
characteristics; for example, performance and responsiveness might indicate the same behavior.

- synergistic: you often cannot choose one architectural characteristic without considering how it may affect others.

- overabundant: possible architectural characteristics are extraordinarily abundant, and new ones appear all the time; for example, a few years ago there was no such thing as on-demand elasticity via a cloud provider

## Explicit vs Implicit

**Explicit** architectural characteristics are specified in the requirements for the application.
- we must support hundreds of users

**Implicit** architectural characteristics are factors that influence an architectâ€™s decisions but arenâ€™t explicitly called out in the requirements.
- we need to protect the privacy of users

- architects should pay attention to the applicationâ€™s internal structure as developers create it, to ensure that sloppy coding and other deficiencies donâ€™t degrade the longevity of the application.


## Zoo "-ilities"

1. **Process architectural characteristics** - where the software development process intersects with software architecture. 


- _agility_ (_modularity_, _testability_, _deployability_, and others)- facilitates and enables agile software development practices.
- _modularity_ - the degree to which the software is composed of discrete components; affects how architects partition behaviour and organize loigcal building blocks.
- _testability_  refers to testing at development time (unit testing) rather than formal quality assurance.
- _deployability_ - how easy and efficient it is to deploy the software system.
- _extensibility_ - how easy it is for developers to extend the system. This may encompass architectural structure, engineering practices, internal design, and governance.
- _decouple-ability (coupling)_ - describes how parts of the system are joined together. Some architectures define how to _decouple_  parts in specific ways to achieve certain benefits;
